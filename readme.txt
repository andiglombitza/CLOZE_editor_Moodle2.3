INSTALLATION

1. Unzip
2. copy the CONTENTS (excluding version.php!) of the directory "clozeeditor" to the directory lib/editor/tinymce on your Moodle installation, keeping the directory structure.

ATTENTION: DO NOT OVERWRITE lib/editor/tinymce/version.php as this would break TinyMCE; the version.php in the download package can be ignored/deleted.

The following file in your installation will be OVERWRITTEN with a mod'd file (so make sure to BACK IT UP):

lib/editor/tinymce/lib.php
